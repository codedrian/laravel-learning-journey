## What I learned:
- I learned how to create a reusable UI elements using blade component. This helps me to organize my views and keep my code DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself ).
- I learned how to pass data from my controller's method to view using `compact()` function`.
- I also explored how to pass data to Blade components. This allows me to customize the component based on the data I passed.
