## What I learned:
- I learned how to create a reusable UI elements using blade component. This helps me to organize my views and keep my code DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself ).
- I learned how to pass data from my controller's method to view using `compact()` function`.
- I also explored how to pass data to Blade components. This allows me to customize the component based on the data I passed.
- I learned that he `Illuminate\Http\Request` instance provides a variety of methods for examining the incoming HTTP request. In this activity, I styled the navigation link that matches the current page. I did it with the help of `request()->is('uri'). That method allows me to verify that the incoming request path matches a given pattern
