## TODO:

- [x] When the user visits "/say/hello", have the request be handled by hello method in the class called 'UserController' (in the controller folder).  Have this method simply echo "Hello World!"
- [x] When the user visits "/say_anything/___", whatever was in ___, have this be simply be echoed.  For example, if the user visit "/say_anything/awesome", the http response should simply be "AWESOME" all in capital.
- [x] When the user visits "/main", have this request be handled by the index method in the Main controller.  Have it simply say "I am Main Class!"
- [x] When the user visits "/danger", have this request be handled by a method called 'danger' in the UserController.  Have it simply redirect back to "/main"
